# ZK-Storage — Storage Access Circuits Specification
- Membership-based access
- Time-locked access
- One-time access


---


### Access Nullifier


A unique value generated when access is exercised.


Purpose:
- Prevents replay of access proofs
- Enables one-time or rate-limited access


---


## Circuit: `access-proof.circom`


### Statement Proven


The prover demonstrates that:
1. They control a valid identity or membership secret
2. They satisfy the access policy for the file
3. The file commitment exists in the authorized set
4. The access nullifier has not been used before


---


### Public Inputs


- File commitment root
- Access nullifier
- Policy identifier


### Private Inputs


- Identity secret or membership proof
- Policy data
- Merkle path


---


### Privacy Guarantees


- File identity remains hidden
- Access patterns are unlinkable
- No leakage of policy structure


---


## Non-Goals


ZK-Storage does NOT attempt to:
- Store files on-chain
- Replace decentralized storage networks
- Hide network-layer metadata


---


## Security Notes


- Encryption must be authenticated (AEAD)
- Keys must be handled securely client-side
- Proof replay must be strictly prevented


---


## MVP Scope


For the initial MVP:
- Single access policy per file
- Membership-based authorization
- One-time access nullifiers


---


## Summary


ZK-Storage provides **cryptographically enforced access control** for encrypted data, completing Z-Kora’s privacy stack without ever exposing sensitive information.
