# Zero-Knowledge-Circuits
This step defines the privacy core of Z-Kora. No smart contracts or UI logic are written before the ZK circuits are conceptually clear.

Design Rules (Mandatory)

All Z-Kora circuits MUST follow these rules:

No business logic — circuits only prove correctness

Minimal disclosure — prove the smallest possible statement

Composable — reusable across modules

Chain-agnostic — no blockchain assumptions

Audit-first — clarity over cleverness
