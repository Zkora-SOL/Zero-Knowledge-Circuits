# ZK-ID — Identity Circuits Specification


---


## Circuit: `selective-disclosure.circom`


### Statement Proven


The prover demonstrates that:
1. They control a valid identity commitment
2. A specific attribute satisfies a condition


Examples:
- Age ≥ 18
- Country ∈ allowed set
- KYC status = verified


---


### Public Inputs


- Merkle root
- Attribute condition


### Private Inputs


- Identity secret
- Attribute value
- Merkle path


---


### Privacy Guarantees


- Only the truth value of the condition is revealed
- Attribute values remain private


---


## Non-Goals


ZK-ID does NOT attempt to:
- Replace government identity systems
- Store biometric or personal data
- Enforce identity issuance policies


---


## Security Notes


- Identity secrets must be securely stored client-side
- Nullifiers must be context-specific
- Identity tree updates must be authenticated


---


## MVP Scope


For the initial MVP:
- Simple membership proofs
- Single attribute condition
- Static identity set


---


## Summary


ZK-ID enables **anonymous yet accountable interactions**, forming the identity backbone of Z-Kora without compromising user privacy.
