# Common ZK Circuits — Shared Primitives
### Requirements


- Collision resistance
- Preimage resistance
- Compatibility with on-chain verifier


Example hash functions:
- Poseidon
- MiMC
n
---


## Circuit: `merkle.circom`


### Purpose


Provides Merkle tree membership verification.


Used to prove:
- A commitment exists in a known set
- State inclusion without revealing position


### Properties


- Fixed-depth trees (MVP)
- Binary Merkle trees
- Root exposed as public input


---


## Circuit: `nullifier.circom`


### Purpose


Generates unlinkable nullifiers to prevent replay and double-use.


Used in:
- Payments (double-spend prevention)
- Identity (one-proof-per-context)
- Storage (access replay prevention)


### Properties


- Deterministic per secret + context
- Unlinkable across different contexts


---


## Security Notes


- Hash parameters must never change silently
- All primitives must be reviewed independently
- Versioning is mandatory for upgrades


---


## MVP Scope


For the initial MVP:
- Single hash function across all circuits
- Fixed Merkle tree depth
- Simple nullifier derivation


---


## Summary


Common circuits form the **cryptographic backbone** of Z-Kora. Any weakness here propagates system-wide, so simplicity and rigor are prioritized over optimization.
